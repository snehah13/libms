A Library Management System (LMS) is a software application designed to manage the operations of a small library. This system will help in maintaining a catalog of books and handling various tasks such as viewing, adding, deleting, borrowing, and returning books. It is ideal for small-scale libraries, providing an easy way for both staff and users to manage library resources.

Core Features of the System:
View Books: Users can view the list of available books, including details like title, author, and availability.
Add Books: Library staff or administrators can add new books to the library catalog by providing book details such as title, author, and ISBN.
Delete Books: Books can be removed from the catalog when they are no longer needed or outdated.
Borrow Books: Users can borrow books from the library. The system will update the availability status of the book (e.g., "borrowed" or "available").
Return Books: Users can return books they have borrowed, and the system will update the bookâ€™s status to "available" again.
Data Structure:
The system can use a list of dictionaries where each dictionary contains the book's details, such as:
title: Name of the book
author: Name of the author
status: Whether the book is available or borrowed
ISBN: Unique identifier for each book (optional)
Operations:
View: Display the list of books with their status (available/borrowed).
Add: Insert new book details into the list.
Delete: Remove a book based on its title or ISBN.
Borrow: Change the book's status to borrowed and check availability before borrowing.
Return: Change the book's status to available when returned.
This system can be further enhanced by adding features such as user registration, due dates, or overdue book tracking, but this basic version focuses on managing books efficiently with simple operations.
